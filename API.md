# DumbBudget API Documentation

This document describes the API endpoints available for DumbCal integration with DumbBudget.

## Authentication

All API requests must include the `DUMB_SECRET` in the request headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_DUMB_SECRET
```

If the secret is invalid or missing, the API will return a 401 Unauthorized response.

## Endpoints

**Query Parameters:**
- `start_date`: (Required) Start date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Example Request:**
```
GET /api/calendar/transactions?start_date=2024-03-01&end_date=2024-03-31
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_DUMB_SECRET
```

**Response Format:**

**Error Responses:**
- 400 Bad Request: Invalid date format or missing parameters
- 401 Unauthorized: Invalid or missing DUMB_SECRET
- 500 Internal Server Error: Server-side error

## Rate Limiting
To prevent abuse, the API is rate-limited to 100 requests per hour per API key.

## Recurring Transactions
When a transaction is recurring, the API will generate instances based on the pattern and return them in the response. Each instance will have:
- A unique ID formed by combining the parent ID and instance date
- The `isRecurringInstance` flag set to true
- A reference to the parent transaction ID in the `recurringParentId` field
- All other properties from the parent transaction, with the date adjusted according to the pattern

The original transaction will also appear in the results if its date falls within the requested range.

For weekly recurring transactions with a specified weekday:
- The original transaction's date will be adjusted to the first occurrence of the specified weekday
- For example, if you create a transaction on 2/1/2025 (Saturday) that recurs every 2 weeks on Monday:
  - The original transaction will be saved with date 2/3/2025 (first Monday)
  - Recurring instances will be generated for 2/17/2025, 3/3/2025, etc.

The API handles these recurring patterns:
- Daily: "every N day"
- Weekly: "every N week on {weekday}"
- Monthly: "every N month"
- Yearly: "every N year"

Where:
- N is a positive integer
- weekday is lowercase (monday, tuesday, etc.)
- Patterns exactly match DumbCal's format for seamless integration
